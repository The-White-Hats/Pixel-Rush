# Future work
  This file contains our plans for future enhancement to Pixel Rush

## Follow a different approach for transmitting a second player's behavior
  Instead of sharing the boolean array for a player's movements, we can locally process all the player movements,  
  They share the position of the player and the state of the car, this will provide better synchronization to the game

## Change the graphics mode to 640X480
  This will allow for better resolution, more space for the track, and more detailed graphics for the cars

## Use more car models
  Allow the players to choose between more car models

## Merge the two phases of the game to allow the players to decide from the home screen between  playing on the same window or two separate windows whether on the same computer or two separate computers
